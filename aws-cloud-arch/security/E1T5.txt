Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

- EC2 instance role gives access for all actions to all S3 buckets.

  Statement:
    - Effect: Allow
      Action: 's3:*'
      Resource: '*'

- WebAppSG has ingress to all traffic as an add-on rule.

    SecurityGroupIngress:
    - IpProtocol: -1
      CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0

- Public ip address assigned to ec2 running webapp in public subnet and port 22 is exposed.

    - IpProtocol: tcp
      FromPort: 22
      ToPort: 22
      CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
