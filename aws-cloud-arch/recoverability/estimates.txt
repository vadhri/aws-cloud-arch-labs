1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage

Minimum RTO = 60-120 seconds
Documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html

60-120s to switch of AZ. 


2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage

Typically when there is a read replica, the solution is read transaction heavy. If the region where the outage happened is DBMaster region, then the read replica can be promoted for usage. 

A. Promote the read replica in a different region to DBMaster. 
B. Configure the micro service or app to interact with the new DB arn. 
C. [Optional] Spin up another master to create the same set up of Master, Slave since after (B) there is only one master and no replica. 

A + B = 5 mins + ( time required to configure app ) 10 mins

~ 15 mins

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage

No RPO since the traffic is diverted to the 'other' AZ. ( configured to be multi AZ )

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage

Outage of read replica region : no RPO, spin up another read replica and no data is lost. ( only RTO is impacted ) 
Outage of master region : 

Automated backups are available daily and transaction logs until last 5 mins. 

Time taken = T(Create new db + restore from back up and s3 logs) + T(point apps to new instance of RDS)

	  = 30 mins + K (large db size) + 10 mins

Minimum RPO : 45mins - 1 hr
